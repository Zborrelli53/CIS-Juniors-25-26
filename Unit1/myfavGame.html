            <h3>How i Discovered <em>Bugsnax</em>:</h3>
            <p>Back in <Strong>2021</Strong>, i was staying the night at my friend's house. We were talking, playing video games together, making jokes, and overall having a blast! <br>Then during the evening he wanted to show me a new game he recently bought. That game, was <Strong><em>Bugsnax</em></Strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>What is <em>Bugsnax</em>?</h3>
            <p><strong><em>Bugsnax</em></strong> is a single player story adventure game where you play as an un-named journalist who travels to the far off island called <strong><em>Snaktooth Island</em></strong>. <br>You were invited by the famous adventurer <em>Lizbert Megafig</em> to interview the other Grumpuses that followed her on her journey to Snaktooth and discover the various creatures <br>that inhabit the island. These creatures are called, <strong><em>Bugsnax</em></strong></p>
            <p>You wake up on Snaktooth Island after a giant "Snak" destroys your hot air balloon-Ship, where you meet one of the Residents of <strong>Snaxburg</strong>, <br><em>Filbo Fiddlepie</em>. You must then use a device called a "Snak Trap" to catch the local "Snax" and feed them to Filbo. He will then escort you to the run-down village of <strong><em>Snaxburg</em></strong>.<br> After interviewing "Filbo", he will give you the task of returning the rest of the <strong><em>Grumpuses</em></strong> back to "Snaxburg" and interview them.</p>
